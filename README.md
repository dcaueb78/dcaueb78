### Hi there! 👋

My name is Cauê Kotarski from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Software Engineer since 2018 and currently I'm a Microsoft Student Partner, Community Manager and Speaker.

In my free time I like to play video-games (:video_game:), to spend time with my friends (:heart:), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚) I love sooo much traveling (:airplane:), take pictures (:camera:) and Organize events (🎉).

Would you like to find me?
